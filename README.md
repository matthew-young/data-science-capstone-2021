# data-science-capstone-2021
 My capstone project for Udacity's Data Science nanodegree program

## Project Definition

In this project we will investigate the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) and use Singular Value Decomposition to see if we can predict what type of occupation someone has based on how they spend their day. We will also take a quick look to see if the data supports Stanley Robert Parker's thesis in The Future of Work and Leisure people who have more say in decision-making at their jobs (autonomy) participate in more active leisure activities than those who have low autonomy in their jobs.
